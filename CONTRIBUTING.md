# Development process 

Issues for the Library Simplified project are tracked through [the Jira installation](https://confluence.nypl.org/display/SIM/Bugs+and+Issues).

General development discussions happen in the [Library Simplified Slack](https://confluence.nypl.org/display/SIM/Slack). 

Changes to the product are made through pull requests on Github. All pull requests must pass code review.

To pass code review, all server-side code must have unit test coverage. Reviewers will advise as necessary how to create appropriate tests.

All contributors must abide by the project [Code of Conduct](https://confluence.nypl.org/display/SIM/Code+of+Conduct).

Information on this wiki is intended for an audience of developers. The [project Confluence page](https://confluence.nypl.org/display/SIM/) is intended for an audience of librarians and administrators.
